## 🌊 Project Overview

**Water Pollution Predictor** is a machine learning-powered web app that forecasts pollutant levels in water and determines whether it's **Safe**, **Moderately Safe**, or **Unsafe** for drinking — based on **year** and **station ID**.

🧑‍🎓 This project was completed as part of my **internship program at [Edunet Foundation](https://edunetfoundation.org/)**, where I explored real-world applications of machine learning, model deployment, and web-based data presentation.

## 🧪 Key Features

- Predicts 6 major water quality parameters:
  - **O₂** (Dissolved Oxygen)
  - **NO₃** (Nitrate)
  - **NO₂** (Nitrite)
  - **SO₄** (Sulfate)
  - **PO₄** (Phosphate)
  - **Cl** (Chloride)
- Provides individual pollutant-wise safety status
- Delivers a final verdict: ✅ Safe / ⚠️ Moderate / ❌ Unsafe
- Built with an easy-to-use **Streamlit** interface
- Model hosted using **Hugging Face Hub**
- App deployed live via **Streamlit Cloud**
